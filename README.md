Welcome to the Zomato Project repository. This project aims to simulate a basic version of the Zomato application using Python and SQLite for data storage and management.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains all photo files.
- `zomato.db`: The SQLite database file.
- `insertion.py`: Script used to add data to the database.
- `database.py`: Script used to create the SQLite database.
- `MainCode.py`: Main application code to run the project.
- `ER_Diagram.png`: Entity-Relationship diagram of the database.
- `Relational_Diagram.png`: Relational diagram of the database.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Run the main application:

    ```bash
    python MainCode.py
    ```

## Notes
